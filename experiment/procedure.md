* Based on the geometry of the mechanism the position analysis of the mechanism is performed. Vector loop formulation is used here.
* Based the position analysis the vector loops obtained in the position analysis are differentiated to get velocity loops for each link.
* The velocity analysis is further used to calculate the necessary forces in the acceleration analysis. Due to the presence of a simultaneous sliding and rotating member the Coriolis and slip components of acceleration of that link are also calculated.
* These values are tabulated for the user.
